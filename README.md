# ESG Reporting and Climate Disasters

This project explores the impact of climate disaster exposure on the language and content of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reports. Specifically, we analyze how firms communicate risks, opportunities, and overall responses to climate disasters using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Background
ESG reporting has become a critical tool for companies to communicate their activities and manage investor concerns. Literature highlights:

- ESG reporting affects risk premia and financial performance ([1-3]).
- Reports serve as signaling mechanisms for investors ([4]).
- ESG scores by institutions lack transparency and are sensitive to weighting ([5]).
- NLP provides alternative methods for estimating ESG sentiment ([6-10]).

## Objectives
- Examine how climate disasters influence ESG reporting language.
- Investigate whether disasters prompt firms to focus on opportunities arising from climate change.
- Understand systematic differences in firm responses to disasters.

## Findings
- Limited evidence suggests climate disasters lead to increased reporting on climate-related opportunities.
- No systematic explanation for varying firm reactions to disasters.

## Methodology
- Analysis of ESG reports using NLP techniques.
- Estimation of ESG sentiment through alternative measures.
